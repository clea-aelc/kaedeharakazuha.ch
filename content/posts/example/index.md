# The Secret History

### The Plot

Donna Tartt's "The Secret History" is a novel that has captivated readers since its publication in 1992. The story follows a group of students studying Classics at a small college in Vermont, who become entangled in a murder plot. The novel is a combination of psychological thriller, murder mystery, and literary fiction, with a richly drawn cast of characters and a complex, multi-layered plot.

The protagonist, **Richard Papen**, is a transfer student who becomes fascinated by an exclusive group of students who are studying under the tutelage of the charismatic Classics professor *Julian Morrow*. Richard is eventually accepted into the group, which consists of five other students: *Henry, Bunny, Charles, Camilla, and Francis.* The group is tight-knit and exclusive, with a shared love of Classical Greek literature and philosophy.

As the novel progresses, the group becomes increasingly isolated and insular, and their intellectual pursuits take a dark turn. They become involved in a series of morally questionable activities, including drinking, drug use, and secret rituals. Eventually, their actions lead to the murder of Bunny, one of their own.

The novel is a masterful exploration of the themes of friendship, loyalty, morality, and the nature of guilt. Tartt's prose is lush and evocative, drawing the reader into the world of the novel and creating a sense of tension and unease that builds throughout the story. The characters are complex and fully realized, with their flaws and virtues laid bare.

"The Secret History" is a literary tour de force that has been praised for its skillful plotting, evocative prose, and rich characterizations. It is a novel that will keep readers engaged and guessing until the very end, and is a must-read for anyone who loves psychological thrillers or literary fiction.

### Greek Literature 

Greek literature and philosophy are central themes in Donna Tartt's "The Secret History". The novel explores the characters' **fascination with ancient Greek culture and their attempts to live according to the ideals of classical literature.**

The group of students in the novel are all studying Classics with their enigmatic professor, *Julian Morrow*. They are deeply immersed in the works of ancient Greek philosophers and poets, and their conversations are peppered with references to Plato, Homer, and other Greek thinkers. They view themselves as part of an exclusive intellectual community, with a shared belief that the classics are the key to understanding the world and living a meaningful life.

> “It's a very Greek idea, and a very profound one. **Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it. And what could be more terrifying and beautiful, to souls like the Greeks or our own, than to lose control completely?** To throw off the chains of being for an instant, to shatter the accident of our mortal selves? Euripides speaks of the Maenads: head thrown I back, throat to the stars, "more like deer than human being." To be absolutely free! One is quite capable, of course, of working out these destructive passions in more vulgar and less efficient ways. But how glorious to release them in a single burst! To sing, to scream, to dance barefoot in the woods in the dead of night, with no more awareness of mortality than an animal! These are powerful mysteries. The bellowing of bulls. Springs of honey bubbling from the ground. If we are strong enough in our souls we can rip away the veil and look that naked, terrible beauty right in the face; let God consume us, devour us, unstring our bones. Then spit us out reborn.”

However, the characters' obsession with Greek literature also leads them down a dangerous path. Their pursuit of knowledge and understanding turns into a desire for power and control, and they become involved in a series of morally questionable activities, including drug use, secret rituals, and ultimately murder.

**The novel uses the Greek literary theme to explore deeper questions about the nature of morality, the dangers of intellectualism, and the human desire for meaning and purpose. It also serves as a commentary on the power of literature to shape and influence our lives, and the dangers of taking those influences too far.**



### The Concept of Villainy

In Donna Tartt's novel "The Secret History", the **concept of villainy is complex and multi-layered**. While there is a murder that takes place, and the characters involved in it could be considered the antagonists of the story, it is not so simple to identify a clear-cut villain.

The group of students who commit the murder are a complex and nuanced group of characters, and each of them has their own motivations and justifications for their actions. *Some could argue that the real villain of the story is the group as a whole, with their shared obsession with Greek literature and philosophy leading them down a dangerous path.*

> „Forgive me, for all the things I did but mostly for the ones that I did not.”

However, if one were to pinpoint a character who could be considered the primary antagonist of the story, it would likely be Bunny Corcoran. Bunny is a charismatic and likable member of the group, but he is also selfish, manipulative, and ultimately becomes the catalyst for the events that lead to the murder.

It is important to note, however, that **the novel is not necessarily concerned with traditional notions of good and evil or hero and villain. Rather, it is an exploration of the complexities of human behavior and the darker aspects of human nature.**



### The „dark academia“ genre

"The Secret History" is considered a quintessential example of a "dark academia" novel. Dark academia is a subgenre of contemporary literature that typically involves stories set in academic institutions, where the characters are obsessed with intellectual pursuits and often engage in dark or morally questionable activities.

The novel's themes of intellectual obsession, moral ambiguity, and the power dynamics of exclusive communities are all hallmarks of the dark academia genre. It is also notable for its vivid and atmospheric depiction of the academic setting, which serves as a backdrop for the characters' descent into darkness.

Overall, "The Secret History" is a masterful example of the dark academia genre, with its exploration of the intersection between intellectualism and morality, and its evocative portrayal of academic life
